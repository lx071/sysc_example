SystemC
The language for System-level design, modeling and verification
SystemC is a single, unified design and verification language that expresses architectural and other system-level attributes in the form of open-source C++ classes. 
It enables design and verification at the system level, independent of any detailed hardware and software implementation, as well as enabling co-verification with RTL design. 
This higher level of abstraction enables considerably faster, more productive architectural trade-off analysis, design, and redesign than is possible at the more detailed RT level. 
Furthermore, verification of system architecture and other system-level attributes is orders of magnitude faster than that at the pin-accurate, timing-accurate RT level.


The SystemC library contains a simulation kernel. 
This decides which processes (software threads) to run. 
At time 0, all SC_METHODs and SC_THREADs will run in an undefined order, until they suspend. 
Then SC_CTHREADs will run when a clock edge occurs.

·A thread is a function made to act like a hardware process
·SystemC supports three kinds of threads
    ·SC_METHOD()          ·Analogous to a Verilog @always block   ·Synthesizable      ·Limited to one cycle
    ·SC_THREAD()          ·Similar to a Verilog @initial block    ·NOT Synthesizable
    ·SC_CTHREAD()         ·References a clock edge                ·Synthesizable      ·Not limited to one cycle

sc_signal is an example of a primitive channel, a built-in channel within the SystemC class library. It behaves like a signal in VHDL.


1. cd ~/Downloads/
2. tar -zxvf systemc-2.3.4.tar.gz
3. cd systemc-2.3.4
4. mkdir objdir
5. cd objdir
6. sudo mkdir /usr/local/systemc-2.3.4/
7. ../configure --prefix=/usr/local/systemc-2.3.4/
//cd .. && autoreconf -ivf  (aclocal-1.13: command not found)
8. make
9. make check
10. sudo make install

g++ main.cpp -I /usr/local/systemc-2.3.4/include -L /usr/local/systemc-2.3.4/lib-linux64 -o hello -l systemc

-I /home/user/systemc/include -L /home/user/systemc/lib-linux -o hello -l systemc
这个命令参数比较多，说明如下：
-I /home/user/systemc/include  告诉g++编译器去/home/user/systemc/include下去寻找所需的头文件即systemc.h
-L /home/user/systemc/lib-linux  告诉ld链接器去/home/user/systemc/lib-linux下去寻找所需的库文件声明
-o hello  标准的输出参数，生成的可执行文件名为hello
-l systemc  告诉ld链接器最终的库文件是libsystemc.a

修改.bashrc（可以修改~/.bashrc，也可以修改/etc/.bashrc），在文件末尾添加
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY:/usr/local/systemc-2.3.4/lib-linux64
